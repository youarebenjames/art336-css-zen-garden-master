# CSS Zen Garden Project
For this project you will be required to create your own <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank" title="CSS Zen Garden">CSS Zen Garden</a> design and submit it to their site. You will start with the same blank template that all the other Zen Garden designs started with.

## Requirements & Restrictions
- Your site must be mobile first with at least 2 breakpoints.
- HTML & CSS Only!
- No jQuery or Javascript!
- You must test your site on IE9, and Safari, Chrome, Firefox and iOS and Android.
- You must read and follow the additional guidelines on the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank" title="CSS Zen Garden">CSS Zen Garden</a> website.

## Other Notes
- Images are saved in the root folder. This is the same location where your index.html and styles.css files are.
- You will have your .scss files compile to the styles.css file. We will cover this slight change in class.
